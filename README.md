Final project for Information Visualization course at RomaTre University
The TV show "Game of Thrones" is based on the book series "A Song of Ice and Fire" by George R. R. Martin and is one of the most popular TV shows in the previous years. In 2016, HBO released the following infographic that shows how the key players related to each other during the "Tower of Joy" moment.

This graphic inspired the Graph Drawing 2018 Contest Committee to create a contest topic for Game of Thrones character relations. They extracted the relations between the most important characters in the show as of the end of Season 7 from the Game of Thrones Wiki (https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki).

The graph consists of 84 nodes (characters) and 216 edges (relations).

The graph can be found here (http://mozart.diei.unipg.it/gdcontest/contest2018/got-graph.graphml) in GraphML format.
